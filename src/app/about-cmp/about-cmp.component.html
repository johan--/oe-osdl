    <h2>About the Oregon Spatial Data Library</h2>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>Mission</strong><br></p>
    <p>The Oregon Spatial Data Library provides public access to reliable and up-to-date spatial data. The Oregon Spatial Data Library is a joint effort between the Department of Administrative Services Geospatial Enterprise Office and Oregon State University.
        Currently, hundreds of spatial datasets are accessible from the Oregon Spatial Data Library, including all of the statewide framework data available for Oregon. These datasets serve as base data for a variety of Geographic Information System
        (GIS) applications that support research, business and public services. </p>
    <p></p><br>
    <p><strong>Audience</strong><br></p>
    <p>The targeted primary users for the Oregon Spatial Data Library are staff of agencies participating in the Oregon Geographic Information Council (OGIC), including Federal, State, and local governments and tribes. Secondary users include the general
        public, consultants, educators, and students. </p>

            <p><strong>Collection Guidelines:</strong><br></p>
            <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp; Data and metadata are in their final form.</p>
            <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp; Metadata complies with OSDL minimum metadata requirements.</p>
            <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp; All file names and attributes are well described and interpretable. Any acronyms used are defined in the metadata.</p>
            <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp; The data has potential value for other application areas or to support decision making.</p>
            <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp; The geographic extent is substantial (approximately the size of an average county or 4<sup>th</sup> field HUC (700 square miles)), or the extent covers a city.</p>
